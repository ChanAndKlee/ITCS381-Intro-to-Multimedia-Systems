# ITCS381 Intro to Multimedia Systems

#### This is a compilation of all projects that I have done within the introduction to multimedia systems class.

Currently, it consisted of five projects:
1. Triangulation Matting

3. Seam Carving
4. Inpainting
5. Color Transfer
6. Mini-Animation

There is a folder for each project containing both assignment paper, source code, and output. All of the listed projects have been done by using MATLAB except the last project that using P5 Javascript.

Thanks to all greatest support, no you, no me, no these projects :3
